                      The IDR Virtual Analysis Environment (VAE) supports the open and reproducible analysis of data in the IDR.
                      It is built on <a href="https://zero-to-jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">JupyterHub</a> and is available to anyone interested in exploring and mining the diverse and vast range of image data and metadata in the IDR.</p>

                          All notebook sessions are subject to available resources, are limited in the network resources they can access, and will automatically terminate after a period of inactivity. Do not store anything you wish to keep.

                        If you are interested in developing your own data analysis notebooks on our analysis platform please contact us with your GitHub username.
                        This will give you more computational resources including scratch storage space than is available through the public access.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        We will do our best to maintain this scratch space across upgrades of the VAE, though in the event of unforeseen issues we may need to delete all scratch space, and you should consider it as suitable for temporary storage only.
                        If as part of a planned update we need to delete our existing storage we will give at least one week's notice on <a href="https://github.com/idr-contrib/community/issues"> idr-contrib/community</a>.

                        This is currently a demonstrator, and is identical to the public access.
                        Please note that we are unable to investigate authentication errors between your chosen identity provider and Elixir AAI.</p>
