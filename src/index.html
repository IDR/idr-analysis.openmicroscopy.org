                        <p>The IDR Analysis Platform supports the open and reproducible analysis of data in the IDR. It is built on <a href="https://zero-to-jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">JupyterHub</a> and is available to anyone interested in exploring and mining the immense range of image data and metadata in the IDR.</p>
                        <p>All notebook sessions are subject to available resources, are limited in the network resources they can access, and will automatically terminate after a period of inactivity. Do not store anything you wish to keep.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h2>Public access</h2>
                        <p>We have a set of Jupyter Notebooks that can be run by anyone without a login.
                        <div class="row column text-center"><a href="/public/hub/tmplogin" class="large button sites-button">Click here to obtain a temporary session</a></div>

                    <h2>GitHub login</h2>
                        <p>If you are interested in developing your own data analysis notebooks on our analysis platform please contact us with your GitHub username. This will give you more computational resources including scratch storage space than is available through the public access.</p>

                    <h2>Elixir AAI login</h2>
                        <p>If you have an Elixir AAI account you can use it to access the analysis platform. This is currently a demonstrator, and is identical to the public access. Please note we are unable to investigate authentication errors between your chosen identity provider and Elixir AAI.</p>
                        <div class="row column text-center"><a href="/vae-aai/hub/oauth_login" class="large button sites-button">Login with Elixir  AAI</a></div>
